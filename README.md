# GoCRUD

GoCRUD is a simple RESTful HTTP API built in Go using the [Gin framework](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) and [GORM](https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm).

It was built purely for learning purposes.

The initial work was based on the tutorial ["Creating a JSON CRUD API in Go (Gin/GORM)" by Coding With Robby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf_kiH_NPvM).
